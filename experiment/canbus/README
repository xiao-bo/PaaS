computeR.py : compute arduino R 
piMultiReceiver.py : pi as master and do data alignment with multi arduino board. It have to use python3 to run this file
piReceiver.py: pi as master and do data alignment with single arduino board. It have to use python3 to run this file
picanExample.py : example of pi can run pican. It have to use python3 to run this file

grovepi.cpp : pi can read analog signal through grove board
grovepi.h : grovepi.cpp's header file
errorForArduinoPi.py : for demo 9/1, this file can real-time display the error between arduino and edison.
draw.py: this file can draw single curve or muiti curve
data_process.py : this file can compute error between edison and arduino's timestamp

First, piMultiReceiver will collect sensor 1, sensor 2 and sensor 3's counter into 1.txt
and recorded data of alignment sync part into 0010.txt, 0011.txt, 0018.txt
However, arduino's counter will overflow when time is elapsed for 1 hours. 
piMultiReceiver's data alignment protocol will be useless.
In order to fix this problem, we will solve in step 2 and step 5

edison/edisonAsClient.c will collect edison's sendtime into edison.txt

Second, we will use analyzeData.py's function "fixOverflow" to fix overflow problem 
and produce offline1.txt.

Three, we will use analyzeData.py's function "checkEdisonReadTwice" to fix edison's 
problem that edison sometime read same signal twice. So, we use this function to 
remove read second reading. This function will produce edisonRT.txt. 
We have to rename edisonRT.txt into edison.txt

Four, we will use analyzeData.py's function "getEdison0or1023" to split edison.txt
into edison_0.txt and edison_1023.txt. We rename edison.txt into edison_all.txt.

Five, we will use dataAlignment.py to run data alignment protocol in offline situation.
we will used 0010.txt made by step1 to get sync data and redo data alignment.
We have to find correct R and we only try and error.
step 5 will produce offline001x_all.txt, offline001x_0.txt or offline001x_1023.txt

Six, will use draw.py to plot result about edison_all.txt and offline001x_all.txt.
