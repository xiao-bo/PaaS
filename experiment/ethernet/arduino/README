arduino_receiver.py  will receive message from arduino , run on server.
in demoFor5/25, it receives message, computes timestamp and insert influxDB.
It can receive arduino long data and recovery timestamp for long data.
It can receive frequency of 1Hz, 500mHz, 250mHZ, 200mHz and 100mHz data.


arduino_sender.ino will send message to server and run on arduino.
In demoFor5/25, if socket between arduino and server is closed, arduino will
save sense data into memory. Arduino sends long data until socket reopen.
It sense data which change in square wave. 

period.py will compute arduino's period of analog read data

errorForArduinoEdison.py will query to influxDB for 60s data to compute error
on sampling period between arduino and edison and compute sampling period on
arduino . Finially it inserts error and sampling period into influxdb.

computeR.py will compute arduino clock ratio. But it need counter to compute
R.
